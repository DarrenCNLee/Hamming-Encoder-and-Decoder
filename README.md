# Assignment 5: Hamming Codes
This program implements an encoder and decoder that use the Hamming (8,4)
systematic code to encode and decode messages. This allows one error to be
corrected and multiple errors to be detected. If the program can correct the
error, it does so and decodes the message. If there is no error, the message
does not need correction. Otherwise, there is an uncorrectable error and the 
program does not modify the message.

## Building
	$ make
## Running
	$ ./encode [-h] [-i infile] [-o outfile]
	
	-h specifies to print usage and help message then exit program
	-i infile specifies the file for input, default is stdin
	-o outfile specifies the file for output, default is stdout

	$ ./decode [-h] [-v] [-i infile] [-o outfile]
	
	-h specifies to print usage and help message then exit program	
	-v specifies to print out statistics of decoding to stderr
	-i infile specifies the file for input, default is stdin
	-o outfile specifies the file for output, default is stdout
## Cleaning 
	$ make clean
